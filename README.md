# RNA-Seq-Project-2021

ANALYSIS-1

FDR calculation With R

We generate a R function to calculate FDR by using a data frame of all p-values of probe sets as parameter, and return a new data frame for all FDR of corresponding probeset.

ANALYSIS 2

Differentially expressed gene (DEGs) analysis for RNA-seq data.

We used DESeq2 package in R Bioconductor to analyze the read counts from a RNA-seq experiment. The experiment includes 4 cases and 4 control samples.
